	<p>First interview:</p>
	<p>T: how many times a week do you come here?<br />I: once a day, to take my dog for a walk. <br />T: oh really, so you come here everyday?<br />I: yes<br />T: do you know when this lake becomes dry like this? <br />I: possibly a few months ago, I think<br />T: do you usually do a lap around the whole lake? <br />I: Yes, i only do one lap. <br />T: what part of the lake do you like the most?<br />I: the bit that's not sunny. <br />T: do you know if anyone takes care of this lake?<br />I: i don't know. one day i turn up, and it was like this. <br />T: Do you prefer the lake being dry or with water in it?<br />I: I prefer it with water, it's more cooling.</p>
	<p>Second interview:</p>
	<p>T: how many times a week are you here?<br />I: Im here everyday, from 6am to 8pm. I sell tea here. <br />T: Do you know when the lake becomes dry like this? <br />I: Long time ago I think. Since after the pandemic,... but actually this time last year there is a tiny bit of water. And now, honestly there is no water left. (Interview being interrupted by a tea stand customer asking 'how much for my tea')<br />T: so since a year ago?<br />I: actually accurately, it's been dry since before that, maybe even since 3 years ago. then every year when it's raining season, it will retain a tiny bit of water. like this time last year, there was a bit of water. and this time last year there wasn't as much grass as today. when it got sunnier, the water drains away, and the grass becomes very tall since. <br />T: Do you know if the lake is dry intentionally, or unintentionally? Does anyone takes care of the grass?<br />I: Well, there is a few grandpas and grandmas around here that will carry a few buckets of water to the vegetable area and water it.<br />T: Oh the higher up bits and not within the lake right?<br />I: Uh huh, Well before this building (point to one of the newer tall building around), was built, there was plenty of water in the lake. Now there is no surface water in the lake anymore. That's what I think anyway. I don't think anyone around here can drain the water from the lake. <br />T: What part of the lake do you like the most? <br />I: I like? If you want to about 'liking', since it's a lake, I like every part of it, it's cooling so I like it. Wherever it has water and is cooling, I like it. Well this lake has so little water, it's like a 'dead lake', so it ruins the landscape a bit. <br />T: so then do you prefer the lake with water in it? <br />I: of course, if it is a lake, it has to have water in it! There is a lot of people that live around here, so hoping that if there is water in the lake, even more people would come, the locals will like it even more. <br />T: What do you think of the vegetable planting on the side of the lake? Do you like farming?<br />I: Yes, i'm a farmer at my roots. I think it's very advantageous to farm, for everyone. It gives work to older people, they come here and enjoy the trees, the plants, stuff like that. It relieves... many things! Well sometimes, some people may misuse the allotments up like they would use trash leaves and incubate it to make fertiliser ... I think that affects the surroundings a bit...The land here is for the community, maybe they shouldn't fence it up too much... it can affect the community... like the foam boxes, some grandmas store stuff, and it can attracts bugs and mosquitoes. We have tried to talk to them a few times about it... and ugh but it's difficult to eradicate that. <br />T: thank you so much! i'm just asking as i'm new around here, even if it's dry I feel like it's still very beautiful, it has its own beauty. <br />I: you know before, like last year, when the grass was short. it was like a football field, it was insanely beautiful. some families, like saturday evening, a lot of families they come here to camp, or the young adults come here to camp, it's super fun! the only issue is, the young adults have lower awareness. When they finish eating, they throw their trash really messily around the area. So I think that reflects a lot of things... when it's beautiful, you want everyone to enjoy it. But after you enjoy it, you must pick up your own trash. Then it wouldn't affect every thing else. When the lake park was flatter like before, it was very nice. Lots of people come to barbecue, camping... was very nice.</p>
	<p>Third interview:</p>
	<p>T: how often do you come to this lake? <br />I: twice a week. <br />T: what do you come here to do? <br />I: I study near by, and usually before i study, i come here to sit just to enjoy the breeze<br />T: do you know how long this lake has been dry like this? <br />I: since i started studying here it has been dry. like maybe since a month ago. but actually it did have a bit of water then. but the first time i actually came here to sit, it was dry. <br />T: do you think it was intentional that this lake become like this? <br />I: I think this lake was make as a balancing lake for the air. I think it's because of nature that it become dry like this. <br />T: do you know if anyone takes care of this lake?<br />I: In the inside area there (Points towards allotment), there is some people watering. <br />T: what do you come here to do usually? <br />I: i just sit here, enjoying the landscape.<br />T: how do you feel being here: <br />I: really relaxing.</p>
	<p>Fourth interview:</p>
	<p>T: how often do you come here? <br />I: i live around here. <br />T: what are you doing here today? <br />I: i'm just filming for tiktoks. because i live here, i come here almost everyday. i come here to sit and relax, or walk and exercise. <br />T: do you when it starts being dry like this.<br />I: from last year. i moved here last year and it's been dry like this. <br />T: has it has anymore water since you moved here: <br />I: yes yes, it has a tiny bit of water. when it rains more, there's more water. but not like a lot of water. I think it's natural, this lake. If there's rain then there will be water, there's no source of water from anywhere. .<br />T: do you think it was intentional that this lake become like this? <br />I: as there is no water source, i think that it is all nature. <br />T: do you know if anyone takes care of the lake? <br />I: no - the trees and plants grow and dies themselves, using the rain water. <br />T: do you like the lake with or without water? <br />I: I think I prefer the dry lake. because this lake has no source, so I prefer a dryer lake. you can go down there and hang out, have fun. <br />T: do you like farming? <br />I: in the country, i have my own allotment. here, i really like that the park has its own allotment. It's like what nature is like. I like it.</p>
	<p>Fifth interview: <br />T: how often do you come here: <br />I: if im strong, i come everyday. <br />T: do you know when the lake became dry? <br />I: this i'm not sure, feels like its been dry for a while.<br />T: do you think it was intentional that this lake become like this? <br />I: i don't think anyone would intentionally make a lake dry. a lake has to have water in it. <br />T: do you prefer the lake with or without water? <br />I: a lake needs to have water to be useful. <br />T: is it so that the lake could be cooling? <br />I: that's right, it's a balancing lake. <br />T: what do you do when you come here. <br />I: i just walk around, exercise.</p>
	<p>Sixth interview:</p>
	<p>T: how often do you come here? <br />I: 4-5 a week. <br />T: do you know since when was the lake dry <br />I: I think it's been 2 years. <br />T: do you think it was intentional that this lake become like this? <br />I: I think it's because of drought, because of nature. Well because of nature, if it doesn't rain enough, then it cant have enough water. It's been 2 years right, grandma? <br />T: Do you know if anyone water the grass in the lake?<br />I: Nah, it's all natural. It's all from the mud that sits there, who would water this! <br />T: It's growing so well!<br />I: Yeah, it's from the mud! <br />I2: You could make it morning glory farm.... but only if you're poor...<br />I: Nah, if it rains it will immediately drown it out!<br />I2: Let me tell you, around here, if you sell the house or gets money from your land, you won't even care about it. <br />I: yeah, around here people have got good conditions, why would they farm .... (I2: yeah they rich) I: You go to the market, you can find everything. <br />T: do you prefer the lake with or without water? <br />I: With water ofcourse! Only with water would it be cool and beautiful.<br />T: and this lake is like this because....<br />I: of nature... it doesn't rain so it dries out. how can there be water in this lake if there is no rain. <br />I2: if there is immense amount of water,... that would be so nice<br />I: so beautiful.<br />T: which part of the lake is your favourite<br />I: generally, if it's a lake, where there is water, that's nice.... you know long time ago someone drowned here? <br />T: really? <br />I: yeah, back when it was deep, someone drowned! then they put a warning saying don't go in the water.<br />T: what do you you do here?<br />I: just exercise, (I2: yeah just exercise), it's breezy and cool<br />T: what do you think about urban farming? <br />I: farming? they have improved it all, no one farms anymore. all the rice fields have been gotten rid of. all the communal areas have got no more rice fields, so where to farm?</p>
